                                                           Athens, 23/1/2020
                                                         Ref.: Gen./Εxt./568


      Press release on the representation of controllers before the DPA

In view of the fact that in cases of processing of personal data  considered
by the Authority the controllers often request  to  be  represented  by  the
Data Protection Officer (DPO), the Authority notes the following:


      Data Protection Officers are a key component  of  the  new  system  of
personal data governance, as developed under  the  General  Data  Protection
Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) and Law 4624/2019 (Government Gazette,  A’  137).
DPOs assist the controller in complying  with  the  institutional  framework
for the protection of personal data. However, their opinion is  not  binding
on the controller who has the obligation to take the necessary  actions  and
measures so that that the processing of personal data is in  line  with  the
regulatory framework and demonstrate such compliance (accountability).  When
performing  their  tasks  Data  Protection  Officers  enjoy   autonomy   and
independence, which is not compatible with supporting the lawfulness of  the
processing of personal data by the controller and may create a  conflict  of
interests with their role as the controller’s representative.
      The Authority therefore informs the  controllers  that  they  are  not
allowed to  be  represented  by  the  Data  Protection  Officer  before  the
Authority. It should be clarified that Data Protection Officers are  allowed
to be present only if they wish to attend the Authority’s meetings.
