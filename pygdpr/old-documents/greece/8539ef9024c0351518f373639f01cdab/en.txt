                                Press release

   Investigation regarding access to and inspection by the employer of an
  employee’s emails on a company server, illegal installation and operation
 of a closed-circuit video-surveillance system and infringement of the right
                                  of access

       The  Ηellenic  DPA  in  response  to   a   complaint   conducted   an
investigation regarding the lawfulness of  personal  data  processing  on  a
server of ‘ALLSEAS MARINE S.A.’, as well as the lawfulness of access to  and
inspection of deleted  emails  of  a  senior  manager  for  whom  there  was
suspicion  that  he  had  committed  unlawful  acts  against  the  company’s
interests.
     The Authority found that the company as a controller had complied  with
the requirements of the GDPR and that its internal policies and  regulations
provided for a ban on the use of  the  company’s  electronic  communications
and networks for private purposes, and for the possibility of  carrying  out
internal  inspections.  The  company  therefore  had  a  legal  right  under
Articles  5(1)  and  6(1)(f)  of  the  GDPR  to  carry   out   an   internal
investigation searching and retreating employee’s emails.
      The DPA, on the other  hand,  found  that  the  closed-circuit  video-
surveillance system had  been  installed  and  operated  illegally  and,  in
addition, the recorded material submitted to the  Authority  was  considered
to be illegal.
      Finally, the Authority found that the  company  did  not  satisfy  the
employee’s right of access to his personal data contained in  his  corporate
PC.
     Following the finding that the GDPR had been infringed,  the  Authority
decided in this particular case to  exercise  its  corrective  powers  under
Article 58(2) of the GDPR by means of corrective measures, and decided to:

i) order the company to comply immediately with  the  complainant’s  request
to exercise his right to access  and  information  concerning  his  personal
data stored in the company’s computer that the complainant used, and  inform
the Authority thereof;
ii) ensure within one  (1)  month  of  receipt  of  the  decision  that  the
processing operations which take place by means of  its  video  surveillance
system comply with the provisions of the  GDPR,  and  inform  the  Authority
thereof, and, in particular:
(a) restore the application of the provisions of Article 5(1)(a) and (2)  of
the GDPR in accordance with the grounds of the judgement;
(b) also restore the application of the other  provisions  of  subparagraphs
(b) to (f) of Article 5(1) of the GDPR in so far as the  infringement  found
affects the internal organisation and compliance with the provisions of  the
GDPR  by  taking   all   necessary   measures   under   the   principle   of
accountability;
iii) impose on  the  company  an  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive
administrative fine, as appropriate in the case of illegal installation  and
operation of a closed-circuit video-surveillance system, in accordance  with
the specific circumstances of  this  case,  amounting  to  fifteen  thousand
euros (EUR 15,000.00).

     Decision 43/2019 is available in Greek on www.dpa.gr ( “Decisions”.
