HELLENIC DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY
Athens, 18/3/2020
Ref.: Gen./Ext./2085

Press release on processing of personal data in the context of managing COVID-19
Following its plenary decision No 5/2020, the Authority issued guidelines on
processing of personal data in the context of managing COVID-19. These guidelines
have specified the legal possibilities for the competent public authorities and private
bodies to process data as controllers under the General Data Protection Regulation
2016/679 (hereinafter “GDPR”), Law 4624/2019 1 and other relevant legislation, in
the context of the need to tackle the spread of the virus. The Authority, in relation to
the processing of personal data by employers for the purpose of containing the
spread of COVID-19, among other things, refers to specific issues of lawful
processing of employees’ personal data. The Authority has also drawn attention to
the rules for the processing of personal data of family members or close friends of
persons who have died of COVID-19, as well as the rules for the processing of
personal data by the data subjects-coronavirus sufferers themselves. Finally, the
Authority has addressed the issue of the processing of personal data for journalistic
purposes. See Guidelines here (in Greek).
In view of the above, the Authority points out the following:
1. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must
be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against
other fundamental rights, such as the right to life and health.
2. The controller, both in the public and private sector, in taking the necessary
measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, may process personal data in
accordance with Articles 5, 6 and 9 of the GDPR. In that case, no measure
should in advance be excluded, especially during these critical and
unprecedented circumstances.
3. The legislation on the protection of personal data, in the context of measures
to protect public health in general and the health of data subjects at
workplaces, provides, on the one hand, the appropriate legal bases for the
processing of personal data, and enables, on the other hand, national
legislators to specify delegated processing operations that are necessary for
reasons of public interest including the area of public health and in
accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.
